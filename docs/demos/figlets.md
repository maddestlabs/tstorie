# Figlet Helper Demo

This demo shows the new `drawFigletText` helper function that simplifies drawing figlet text.

API:
`figletLoadFont("standard")`
`drawFigletText (layer, x, y, fontName, text, style, direction, letter-spacing)`

```nim on:init
var fontLoaded = figletLoadFont("standard")
```

```nim on:render
clear()

# Manual way - loop through lines
draw(0, 2, 2, "Manual way:")
var lines = figletRender("standard", "HELLO")
var y = 3
for line in lines:
  draw(0, 2, y, line)
  y = y + 1

# With style
var warning = getStyle("warning")
draw(0, 2, 10, "With style:")
drawFigletText(0, 2, 11, "standard", "STYLED", 0, warning)

# Horizontal with letter spacing
draw(0, 2, 18, "Letter spacing (3):")
drawFigletText(0, 2, 19, "standard", "SPACE", 0, 0, 0, 3)

# Vertical text
draw(0, 45, 2, "Vertical:")
drawFigletText(0, 45, 3, "standard", "HEY", 0, 0, 1, 0)
```
